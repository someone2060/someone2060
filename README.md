# Hi! Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the University of British Columbia interested in all things computer science. I love learning what makes software work, and work well. I have intermediate experience in Python, Java, C++, and Unity. I have beginner experience in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. With UBC Thunderbots, I hope to soar in programming ability.

In high school, I took multiple executive positions in school activities. With Scarlett Robotics, I led a team of approximately 40 members and 5 programmers to place first in provincial qualifications and second in playoffs. Through my experience as a leader, I have learned and applied interpersonal, management, and leadership skills. I plan to further my skills in university, working to maximize the potential of every individual.

Although I am currently enrolled in university, I'm open to internships both in Vancouver and online. If you would like to reach out, send me an email!
