# Hi! Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the University of British Columbia interested in all things computer science. I have intermediate experience in Python, Java, C++, and Unity. I have beginner experience in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. With UBC Thunderbots, I hope to soar in programming ability.

Although I am currently enrolled in university, I'm open to internships both in Vancouver and online. If you would like to reach out, send me an email!
